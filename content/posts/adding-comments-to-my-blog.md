# Motivation
Being relatively new to the world of blogging, I quickly realized that my recently created website was missing a crucial element â€“ reader feedback. It was evident that I needed to find a way to bridge this gap and encourage readers to voice their opinions and thoughts on my posts.

# The Search for a Good Commenting Solution:
Given that my website is hosted on GitHub and relies on static site generation, I was faced with the challenge of finding a commenting solution that seamlessly integrated with this setup. 
Although Hugo comes with support for Disqus as a commenting system, my experience with it was far from ideal. Its slow loading times and intrusive ads were major drawbacks for me. In my quest for a more optimal solution, I came across Giscus. However, while Giscus does have its advantages, such as leveraging GitHub Discussion and being open-source, it's essential to acknowledge its potential downsides as well.

One potential downside of using Giscus is that it might not offer the same level of customization and features as other dedicated comment platforms. Giscus primarily relies on GitHub Issues, which means that the commenting functionality might not be as comprehensive as some other dedicated solutions. This could limit the depth of engagement and interactions within the comment section.

Additionally, Giscus' reliance on GitHub infrastructure means that users commenting on your site would need a GitHub account. This requirement might act as a barrier for some users who don't have or don't wish to create a GitHub account just for leaving comments. This could potentially reduce the overall engagement on your blog, especially among users who prefer anonymity or are unfamiliar with GitHub.
